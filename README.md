# Statistical and Mathematical Methods for Machine Learning

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) featuring exercises and implementations developed for the **Statistical and Mathematical Methods for Machine Learning** course.

The core objective of this project is to bridge the gap between high-level Machine Learning algorithms and the fundamental Linear Algebra and Calculus concepts studied during a bachelor's degree.

## 📌 Project Overview

The repository is structured to follow the progression of the course, moving from optimization theory to practical ML applications.

### 1. Optimization Techniques
Focus on solving the **training problem** in Machine Learning algorithms by minimizing loss functions.
* **Gradient Descent (GD):** Implementation of the standard iterative optimization algorithm.
* **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** Exploration of stochastic variants designed for efficiency and large-scale datasets.

### 2. Machine Learning Foundations
Deep dive into the math behind the most effective "simple" ML algorithms:
* **Supervised Learning:** Focused on **Classification** tasks and how they relate to decision boundaries and linear transformations.
* **Unsupervised Learning:** Implementation of **Dimensionality Reduction** techniques, understanding how they leverage concepts like SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) and Eigendecomposition.

## 🎯 Learning Focus
Unlike standard black-box implementations, the focus here is on:
- **Mathematical Depth:** Understanding the "why" behind each step.
- **Linear Algebra Correlation:** Directly relating implementation logic to vector spaces, projections, and matrix factorizations.
- **Algorithmic Efficiency:** Comparing different optimization strategies like GD vs. SGD.

## 🛠️ Requirements
To run these notebooks, you will need Python and the following scientific libraries:
* `NumPy` (Linear algebra operations)
* `Matplotlib` / `Seaborn` (Data visualization)
* `SciPy` (Optimization and statistics)
* `Jupyter`
