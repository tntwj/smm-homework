    "\n",
    "1. Generate two Gaussian clusters in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and associate them with a class depending on which cluster each point lies on, e.g.:\n",
    "   - Class 0 centered at $(-2, -2)$ with variance $1$,\n",
    "   - Class 1 centered at $(2, 2)$ with variance $0.5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Plot the dataset in 2D using `plt.scatter` so that each cluster is colored according to its class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Implement logistic regression **from scratch** as did during class:\n",

    "4. Train it using simple Gradient Descent on the full dataset. **Note:** the computation of $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}(\\Theta; X, Y)$ for this choice of $\\ell$ is given in the teaching note.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Visualize the learned **decision boundary**:\n",
    "   - plot the line $\\{\\Theta^T x = 0\\}$,\n",
    "   - overlay with the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
